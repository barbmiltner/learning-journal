## About Me
My name is **Barb Miltner** and I am a STEM teacher. Over the years, courses I've taught include AP Computer Science Principles, two engineering courses, various math courses and most recently Healthcare Innovator. I have been teaching at [Xavier High School](https://www.xaviersaints.org/) since 2005 and prior to that I was an engineer at the light company in Cedar Rapids. My husband Mark and I have two kids. We enjoy playing with our three dogs and in our spare time we operate a car wash and laundromat. Here is the [link to my GitHub portfolio page.](https://github.com/barbmiltner)
