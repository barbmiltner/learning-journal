# Lab 01b - Learning Markdown
## “Growth mindset” in my own words:
Having a growth mindset means believing that I can learn and acquire new skills through effort and persistance.
### 3 reminders to myself of how to stay in a growth mindset:
- Don't avoid the struggle.
- Don't give up when it gets boring or difficult.
- Keep the long-term goal in mind.

1. 4 levels of headings
2. bulleted (unordered) lists
3. numbered (ordered) lists
4. bold and italic fonts
5. linked text
